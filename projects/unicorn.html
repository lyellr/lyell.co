        <p class="project-description">Late last fall found me walking in the woods that run alongside the Sudbury River. It was the Friday after Thanksgiving, and I had gone with my brother and my cousin to give the dog a chance to stretch her legs. We eventually found ourselves at the mouth of Fairhaven Bay, looking up at a classic New England style lodge buttressed by a ten-foot stone terrace squared against the bay. Naturally we went up to have a poke around, at which point my brother remembered that whoever had lived here had died not too long ago. We noted the partially detached screens on the back porch, the basement door wedged shut from the outside, the overgrown enclosure that had not so long ago entertained horses. We toyed with the idea of finding a way inside before realizing the dog had disappeared; we set out to find her instead, and eventually made it back home without incident.</p>
        <p class="project-description">The following afternoon, back home on the other side of the river, my mom said she had heard we were at Nat's old house. I paused, confused, and she told me a story. About a year and a half ago, Nat had come to her with a wrapped object and a proposition. He lived across the river from our house, and they knew one another through a mutual involvement with Musketaquid Earth Day, an annual event that involves an arts fair, parade, and river ceremony where a dozen or so floating sculptures are set off down the river. I had enjoyed various small roles in the day since before I could remember, and my mom was one of the driving forces behind the whole affair, particularly the building and releasing of the sculptures, known affectionately as Earth Floats. Nat used to collect the wood used for the bases of the sculptures from the many trails through the Fairhaven woods that he maintained, and he and my mom were friendly acquaintances through this association.</p>
        <p class="project-description">But this year he had come to our house with an idea. Nat said that he had found the horn of a unicorn in the woods, and he unwrapped the package he had brought to my mom. Inside was something of wood or bone that did carry a striking resemblance to a unicorn horn. He proposed that there be a theme of celebrating the magic in nature for Musketaquid that year, that this had been a reminder, a sign, about that magic. My mom later learned that he had gone around to each of the other coordinators, shown them the horn, and proposed this same idea -- itself a degree of asserting his enthusiasm my mom hadn't seen before. Shortly after his visit, he got a group of people together, and they built a life size unicorn out of wood and bittersweet vine, to which they affixed a horn similar to the one he had found. They built a large wooden base, and Nat had a parade-ready unicorn. He had, my mom thought looking back, a hope that children would be dancing around the unicorn in the parade. But other people had their own plans and hopes, and Nat was left pulling the unicorn. About a month later his fianc√© came home to find him in his hammock, having taken his own life. My mom learned that he had struggled with depression for a very long time and eventually couldn't bear the effects of the medication.</p>
        <p class="project-description">She told me that looking back on his visit with the horn, the unicorn and the theme that would bring people together around the magic of the outdoors all seemed part of an attempt to revitalize himself, to bring magic back into his life. Whether or not this was really the case, I took it to heart, and I was immediately and powerfully sad. I had a series of images and emotions playing through my imagination: his sadness, his desperation, his stumble onto a unicorn horn, his idea, his enthusiasm in this attempt at magic, his walk through the parade, his despair. The sense of tragedy held with me hard over that weekend, and morphed over those days and the following months into a song for, as I thought of him, the Unicorn Man. This song is not so much about him, because I didn't know him; rather, it is his story as I experienced it, close to home.</p>
        <p class="project-description">This recording has been blessed by the extraordinary generosity of Ben Mangold, Brooks Birdsall, and Andres Figueredo, all of whom gave much time and heart to the story and my fumbles through the music. Thank you. The kernel of the melody as I imagine it is saying "I tried."</p>
