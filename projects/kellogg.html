        <p class="project-description">The W. K. Kellogg Foundation commissioned a conference and series of television spots to raise awareness about the oral health care access crisis affecting some parts of the United States, particularly New Mexico.</p>
        <p class="project-description">This video was accompanied by a series of shorter spots, each of which needed a distinct theme based around setting. To this end, as the shots move through various parts of the country, the music reflects the changing scenes and stories.</p>
